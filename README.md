# SenseFlow – Smart Ventilation Prototype

SenseFlow is an IoT-based climate assist system designed to enhance existing ventilation systems with real-time indoor air quality monitoring and intelligent airflow control.

## Project purpose
This repository documents the technical development of a prototype developed during an internship in the founder’s own company as part of the IT-Technologist education at UCL.

The focus is on:
- Embedded systems (ESP32)
- Sensor integration (temperature, humidity, air quality)
- Local control and regulation
- Testing and technical documentation

## Repository structure
- /hardware – Schematics, components, wiring notes
- /software – Embedded code and experiments
- /docs – Technical documentation and analysis
- /logbook – Weekly reflections and progress summaries

## Project status
Early prototype and documentation phase.
